The U-Net++ architecture is based on the infamous U-Net architecture which is unlike Basic U-Net architecture has dense skip connections and deep convolutions which makes it available to get added with the other advanced architectures.
In this project you will see the U-Net++ architecture added with latest VGG19 encoder and added with DenseNet and U-efficientNet which is a novel U-Net++ model and unlike the orignal model, it does the segmentation much efficiently than the Original U-Net++ model which is added with VGG16 decoder.
